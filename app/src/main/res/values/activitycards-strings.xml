    <string name="donebaractivity_description">In this presentation, a done bar replaces the action bar entirely, providing
            two direct actions to persist or dismiss changes. This is suitable for cases where no

    <string name="donebuttonactivity_description">In this presentation, a done button replaces the action bar\'s "Up" affordance
            and app icon, while the cancel action is made available in the action overflow. This is
            well-suited to scenarios where additional view details or
            actions may be needed in the action bar.</string>
