## Stock Alarm App

Set and save alerts on your phone for when a particular stock price exceeds or falls below a certain limit; or when the rate of change is unusual. Monitor stock price fluctuations in real-time, or allow the app to run in the background as a service.

## Code Example

## Motivation

Existing apps for stock monitoring imposed impractically low limits on number of stocks to monitor (being unfit for penny stock investors); and they lacked options or customizability with regard to alert type: by phone call, email, etc.

## Installation

The app requires internet permission from Android, but no external libraries. Localization available in Spanish and French.
